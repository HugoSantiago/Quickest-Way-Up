# Quickest-Way-Up

This is a Coding test for DevCo.

The problem was solved with Dijkstra's algorithm. By modeling the problem to a shortest path in a directed graph.

Each position in the board represent a Vertex in the graph.
Each position n can reach n+1, n+2, ..., n+6 Vertex this is giving by the dice.
Each ladder is represented by a new edge as well as the snakes.
